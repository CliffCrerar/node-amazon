# Cyrano: An Angular 2 e-commerce website 
Amazon lookalike with Angular 2 and node. Demo at: http://cyrano.website

## Build (with angular-cli)

Run `ng build` to build the project in development mode. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Run `ng build --prod` for production. Will recommend using AOT for quicker initial load time. Server files are located at `nodeserver/`.
