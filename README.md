# Cyrano: An Angular 2 e-commerce webiste 
Heavily inspired by Amazon. Voted best overall project at DevMountain. Demo at: http://cyrano.website

## Build (with cli)

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. `-prod` flag is broken for now. Server files are located at `nodeserver/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
