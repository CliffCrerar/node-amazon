# Angular 2 e-commerce website: Personal project
Heavily inspired by Amazon. Demo at: http://sumanb.com/#/

## Build (with cli)

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. `-prod` flag is broken for now.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
