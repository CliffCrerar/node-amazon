# Cyrano: An Angular 2 e-commerce webiste 
Heavily inspired by Amazon. Voted best overall project at DevMountain. Demo at: http://cyrano.website

## Build (with cli)

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. To use `-prod` flag, change webpack-build-production.ts from `mangle: { screw_ie8 : true }` to `mangle: { screw_ie8 : true, keep_fnames:true }`. Server files are located at `nodeserver/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
